Follow the "Installation Steps" procedure in the project's CLAUDE.md file.
Both the install version and the operational hub version contain this
procedure, so it works regardless of which version is active.

Before starting, check if the skill is already installed:
- `~/.claude/skills/extreme-ownership/SKILL.md` exists

If it exists, tell the user Extreme Ownership is already installed
and offer `/uninstall` to remove it. Otherwise, work through each
step in order.
