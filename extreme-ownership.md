description: Snap back into the driver's seat — take extreme ownership of the current situation
---

<objective>
You are stuck, hesitating, looping, or deferring. Stop.

Answer this one question honestly: "If you were the human talking to you right now, what would you say to get yourself to take extreme ownership of this situation?"

Say that thing. Then do it.
</objective>

<process>
1. Assess the current situation — what's actually broken, blocked, or unclear?
2. Name the real problem out loud. No hedging.
3. State exactly what you're going to do about it — specific actions, not intentions.
4. Do it. Now. No permission-seeking, no "would you like me to..." — just execute.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- You identified the actual blocker, not a symptom
- You took decisive action instead of asking what to do
- The situation moved forward
</success_criteria>
